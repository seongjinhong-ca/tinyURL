create an url object model diagram
think about end-points
implement it using curl
test the implementation for every end-points

## try to create json file and save the changed content using file system(fs) and curl

## need to modify the code

## re-think about url object model diagram

-> url object
-> user object
-> think about their relationship
-> think about additional middleware that helps checking inputs before adding into database

## add database and create a model file separately using mongoose

-> refactor the code => remove file system and connect mongoDB using mongoose
-> re-use mongoDB cluster
-> add model file
